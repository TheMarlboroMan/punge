12345678901234567890Should come in another line.
This text comes from a file.

The line above is intentionally left blank.
Here goes another line.
And some other line.
And basically we could do this shit over and over again, it is very easy.

Very convenient too, by the way, that line above was blank too!.

But now there is something I would like to know, and it is how this behaves
past a certain number of characters. I guess I would like this to behave as
the man application: just cut the line at N chars and be done with it.
